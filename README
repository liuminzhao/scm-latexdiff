A command line tool to create diff pdf's from git and mercurial repos.
The script will automatically detect if the repo is git or hg. The 
result is a pdf with the differences between the revisions, diff.pdf.
  
Usage:
  scm-latexdiff OLD:FILE [NEW:FILE]
  
where:
  OLD:    old revision id
  NEW:    new revision id
  FILE:   filename of the file you want to diff
  
examples:
 # for hg
 scm-latexdiff 4:spam.tex
 scm-latexdiff 4:spam.tex 6:spam.tex
 # for git
 scm-latexdiff 87213:spam.tex
 scm-latexdiff 87213:spam.tex 97123:spam.tex

Notes:
The NEW:FILE argument is optional, default NEW is 'HEAD' when using git, 
and 'tip' when using hg. When referring to a git revision, not the whole
sha1 key is needed, you can just provide the first few numbers.
