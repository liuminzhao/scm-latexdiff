scm-latexdiff
===========

A command line tool to create diff pdf's from git and mercurial repos.
The script will automatically detect if the repo is git or hg. The
result is a pdf with the differences between the revisions, diff.pdf.

Usage:
  scm-latexdiff OLD:FILE NEW:FILE DIFF_DIR

where:
  OLD:    old revision id, local for non-commited
  NEW:    new revision id, local for non-commited
  FILE:   filename of the file you want to diff
  DIFF_DIR: diff file directory

Examples
========

 # for git
 scm-latexdiff 87213:draft/spam.tex 97123:draft/spam.tex draft

Notes
=====

I kept `diff.aux`, `diff.tex` files and added `DIFF_DIR` to allow troublesome when sometimes `Bibtex` does not work. Please run this script under root directory for the repo.

INSTALL
=======

This tool uses distutils for installation. The following command installs
the tool on your machine:

python setup.py install

To install to a non-standard directory tree (e.g. in your home directory) use
--prefix:

python setup.py install --prefix=/home/spam/. Do remember to add
/home/spam/lib/python2.x/site-packages/ to your PYTHONPATH environment
variable.
